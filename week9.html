        <h2>Task 1: Extract Features</h2>
        <p>
          For this task, I used the <strong>three audio tracks selected in Week 8</strong>.
          Each image below shows the following features:
          <strong>Waveform</strong>, <strong>Spectrogram</strong>, 
          <strong>Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)</strong>, 
          and a <strong>Chromagram</strong>.

        <h2>Task 2: Compute and Visualize Features with Histograms</h2>
        <p>
          For this task, I used Python to compute and visualize histograms of 
          selected audio features for the same three tracks from Week 8.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
             Overall, the histograms look quite similar to each other, which isn’t surprising since they’re all by the same band, and the songs sound quite similar to each other.. It was really interesting to see these patterns visually, and analysing the histograms gave me some useful insights into the similarities in their style and structure.
