    <h1>BASICS OF MUSIC DATA</h1>
    <h2>Week 1</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Lab 1 (Group Task)</h3>
      <h4>Music Data Sources</h4>

      <h5>Spotify</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Provides audio data sorted by artist, album, and genre.</li>
        <li>Curates personalised mixes and playlists for each listener based on listening history and algorithmic preferences.</li>
        <li>Describes data as audio data (e.g., tempo, key, danceability).</li>
        <li>Organises data by genre, artist, and user interaction (e.g., playlists, liked songs).</li>
        <li>Features such as lyric following and song recommendations enhance discovery (e.g., finding songs by lyrics).</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Instagram / TikTok</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Use algorithmic recommendations influenced by friends, followers, and engagement.</li>
        <li>Allow users to add preferences and interact with trends or microtrends.</li>
        <li>Reposting reels or TikToks boosts visibility within social networks.</li>
        <li>Users can click on an audio snippet to explore other videos using the same sound.</li>
        <li>Platforms promote popular sounds and recommend songs for posts based on trends, popularity, and liked content.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h3>Individual Lab (Task 2)</h3>

      <h4>2. Theme for Dataset</h4>
      <p><strong>Theme:</strong> Dire Straits</p>
      <p>Focus on the rock band <strong>Dire Straits</strong> (active 1977–1995).</p>

      <p><strong>Data types available:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Musical scores:</strong> Beginner versions of songs available on Musescore.</li>
        <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Album details, release dates, and genres from sources like Discogs, MusicBrainz, and Spotify.</li>
        <li><strong>Audio recordings:</strong> Studio albums and live performances available on major streaming platforms.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This theme works well because the band’s music spans both analog and digital eras, showing how data moves from physical to digital formats over time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>3. Challenges and Data Discussion</h4>
      <p>Working with music and music-related data can be challenging because it is often scattered across different platforms and inconsistent. For Dire Straits, data appears on Musescore, Spotify, and fan archives, sometimes showing small differences in track versions or release information.</p>

      <p>Older materials like vinyl and liner notes are harder to access online, while newer remasters can cause confusion over the “official” version. Today, their data is mainly curated through streaming platforms and music databases, which organise it by genre, year, and popularity.</p>

      <p>Algorithms analyse and recommend songs, while user-uploaded sheet music adds to the collection. These patterns show how music data is constantly reshaped by technology and user interaction.</p>
