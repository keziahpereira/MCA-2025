        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This week introduced the foundational concepts of music data and curation. We explored how musical information can be represented digitally and how data-driven tools enable analysis and comparison across musical pieces.</p>

      <section class="reflection">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>This week helped me appreciate how data underlies many aspects of music research and production. I found it particularly interesting to see how symbolic representations, such as MIDI and MusicXML, preserve compositional intent, while audio data captures expressive performance nuances. It was my first time looking at music as something that can be quantified, and that shift in perspective was both strange and fascinating.</p>
