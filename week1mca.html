        <h2>Task 1: Identify a Theme for Your Dataset</h2>
        <p>I’ve chosen the theme Classic Rock Music by Dire Straits for my project. I grew up listening to them because they’re one of my dad’s favourite bands, so their music has always been a big part of my life.</p>

        <p>The two songs I’ve chosen are <strong>“Sultans of Swing”</strong> and <strong>“Walk of Life.”</strong> Both are timeless tracks that highlight Mark Knopfler’s distinctive guitar playing and storytelling. “Sultans of Swing” has really good rhythm and tells the story of a small band playing in a pub, while “Walk of Life” is upbeat and full of energy, with its instantly recognisable keyboard riff.</p>

        <p>Dire Straits were formed in 1977 by Mark Knopfler and his brother David. Their blend of rock, blues, and jazz created a sound that remains unique and influential even today.</p>

        <h2>Task 2: Challenges</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges when working with music data is how varied and complex it can be. Music exists in many different formats such as MP3, WAV, or FLAC for audio, and MIDI or MusicXML for digital scores. Each format stores information in its own way, which can make it difficult to analyse everything using the same tools. Sometimes files need to be converted, and that can take time or lead to small changes in the data.</p>

        <p>For my theme, focusing on <strong>Dire Straits</strong>, a key challenge is copyright. Their songs are still protected, so I have to be careful about how I use them. Since this project is for educational purposes, using short sections or encoded data should be fine, as long as I don’t share or distribute the full songs.</p>

        <p>Another challenge is finding good quality data. Official MIDI files or detailed scores aren’t always easy to find, so I might need to use fan-made versions or create some of my own.</p>

        <p>Despite these challenges, I’m excited to explore Dire Straits’ music. Their songs mean a lot to me, and I think it will be interesting to see what kinds of musical patterns and details I can discover through analysis.</p>
