        <p>When I compared the MusicXML file with the MEI file, I noticed quite a few differences in how they are structured and how easy they are to read. The MusicXML file immediately felt more familiar and straightforward to me because it uses full words for its elements, like,octave, duration, and pitch, which makes it much easier to understand what each part refers to without having to look anything up. This was especially clear when looking at pitch: in MusicXML, pitch is written out in a full element with separate parts like step, alter, and  octave, whereas in the MEI file, pitch is reduced to short attributes like pname, accid, and oct all squeezed into one line. MEI, on the other hand, shortens many elements to things like oct, dur, and pname, which definitely makes the file more compact but also less intuitive at first glance. I also realised that MusicXML includes a lot of visual and layout information almost as if it’s trying to show how the music should actually look on the page, whereas MEI focuses much more on the musical meaning itself, MEI also takes more effort to decipher, even though it is more detailed and precise. Overall, I found MusicXML easier to read and more immediately understandable, while MEI feels better suited for deeper analysis where precision and musical semantics matter more than layout.</p>
