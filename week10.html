        <h2>Task 1: Similarity</h2>
        <p>
          For this task, I extracted <strong>Chroma features</strong> in Sonic Visualiser
          for each of the three tracks from Week 8 and used them to generate visual
          similarity comparisons.
        </p>

        <!-- CHROMA FEATURES -->
        <h3>Chroma Features</h3>
        <p>
          The image below shows the chroma output for all three tracks.
          <br>
          <strong>Track 1:</strong> Sultans of Swing  
          <br>
          <strong>Track 2:</strong> Walk of Life  
          <br>
          <strong>Track 3:</strong> Money for Nothing

        <h3>Difference Between the Tracks</h3>
        <p>This comparison highlights where pitch-class activity differs across the three songs.</p>

          This matrix represents the similarity of the 12 pitch classes
          across the three tracks.

          The following graph shows the mean chroma distribution for each track,
          summarising their pitch content tendencies.

    <h2>Task 2: Transcription</h2>
    <p>
      For this task, I opened my Week 2 piece in MuseScore and exported it as both a WAV file 
      and an image. I then opened the WAV file in Sonic Visualiser and generated a 
      Polyphonic Transcription. The outputs below show the original score alongside the 
      automated transcription created by Sonic Visualiser.

    <h3>Comparison Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      When I opened the transcribed piece in MuseScore, I immediately noticed that it looked 
      very different from the original. Notes were missing or changed, and the rhythms didn’t 
      match what I saw in the real score. On top of that, everything looked visually messy – 
      you could clearly see symbols and notes overlapping, which made the transcription 
      confusing to read. The title, composer, and dynamics were also missing.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I also noticed that the audio of the transcription played for longer than the original, 
      which made it feel slightly off. Overall, the automated transcription was not very 
      accurate, even though the audio still sounded somewhat similar to the original piece.
